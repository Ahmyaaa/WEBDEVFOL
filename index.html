        <h5 class="title-person">Art Student in CIIT</h5>
        <p>"As a regular user of social media and other online platforms, I really admire the 
          layout created by JEPP for GoComix. The website they created was highly efficient 
          with their accessibility, but still aesthetically pleasing and well organized.
    
          Additionally, their attention to detail in design elements, such as the use of vibrant 
          colors and visually appealing graphics, creates an engaging and immersive experience 
          for users in both of their website design and previous projects. It's evident that 
          JEPP prioritizes both form and function, ensuring that every aspect of the website 
          contributes to a seamless and enjoyable streaming experience. 
          
          I hope other websites will take note of GoComix and follow JEPP's example of 
          prioritizing design and accessibility to enhance the user experience for all."

        <h3>Sean Warner Dean Datu</h3>

        <p>"I had fun collaborating with Jenna on a web design project, and I must say her 
          work is truly marvelous and spectacular. Jenna has creativity, technical skills, 
          and attention to detail. Her insight into web design is innovative. She doesn't 
          just design good-looking websites, she makes sure they're easy for people to use 
          and simplistic. There is one project that Jenna made is the Algebra Infographic 
          for me it is visually appealing and elegant. The color theme and the arcade style 
          of the work are immaculate. The icons/pictures she used are eye-catching and 
          on-point on each topic. I recommend Jenna for any website job or UI/UX Design. 
          Her skills and her professionalism are really good."</p>

          <h5 class="title-person">Former Colleague in Publication</h5>
          <p>"As someone who frequents websites for watching and streaming, I appreciate the 
            layout they made for GoComix. It is challenging to find websites who utilize design 
            and accessibility especially with streaming sites, they often sacrifice one or the 
            other but with JEPP's case, they made it work: appealing and easy. Looking forward 
            for more collaborations from them and hopefully other websites will take their work 
            as an example!"</p>
